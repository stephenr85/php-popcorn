/**
 * The adapter that carries a {@see Runner} into the array-in/array-out {@see Invocable} world
 * (popcorn-runner ticket 01) — the payoff of the whole seam. Because it *is* an Invocable, a
 * sandboxed run is `CachedInvocable`-wrappable and a legal `Ladder` rung with **no** kernel
 * change; the registry overrides it by name like any other capability.
 *
 * `binding()` is {@see Binding::Local} — locality and mechanism are different axes (popcorn ADR-0001):
 * a sandboxed run is still *local* (it does not cross to a remote service); "sandboxed" is a Grant
 * profile, not a Binding. This is also why a satellite-local transform stays free under the metering
 * doctrine.
 *
 * The {@see Grant} is the *effective* one, resolved host-side and injected when the host builds this
 * invocable during hydration (per-invocation resolution ⇒ rebuild the invocable). `invoke()` is
 * literally `run(…)->throw()->output()`, preserving `ProcessInvocable`'s array-out-or-throw contract;
 * Runner-aware callers (Conduit, meter, audit) read the total {@see Result} via {@see run()} instead.
